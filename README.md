## Description
The proposed flight reservation web application aims to streamline and enhance the travel experience for a diverse user base, including tourists, airline agents, and system administrators. Users and airline agents can seamlessly navigate through the platform to browse, select, and book flights to specific destinations. The graphical seat map facilitates an interactive seat selection process, allowing users to choose between regular, comfort, and business-class seats.

The system incorporates features like ticket cancellation insurance selection, secure credit card payments, and automated issuance of tickets and receipts via email. For enhanced services, registered users enjoy exclusive benefits such as monthly promotions, discounted access to airport lounges, and an annual free companion ticket. Meanwhile, airline agents and flight attendants can efficiently manage passenger lists, while system admins have comprehensive control over flight information, crew management, and database administration.

This adaptable application caters to the dynamic nature of real-world projects, acknowledging potential changes in functional and non-functional requirements during development. Its flexibility allows for adjustments, ensuring it remains responsive to evolving needs and challenges in the flight reservation domain. The application adapts to changes, ensuring stability and efficient management for airline agents, flight attendants, and system administrators alike.
